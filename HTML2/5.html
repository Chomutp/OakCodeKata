        <u>The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince, pronounced )</u>
        is a novella by French aristocrat, writer, and aviator Antoine de
        Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the US by
        Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943, and posthumously in France following
        the liberation of France as Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned by the
        Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various
        planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of
        <i><b>loneliness</b></i> ,<i><b>friendship</b></i
        >,<i><b>love</b></i> , and <i><b>loss</b></i
        >. Despite its style as a children's book, The Little Prince makes
        poignant observations about life and human nature.
